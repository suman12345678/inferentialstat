Part 1: Simulation Exercise Instructions

In this project you will investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. Set lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations. You will investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials. Note that you will need to do a thousand simulations.

Illustrate via simulation and associated explanatory text the properties of the distribution of the mean of 40 exponentials. You should

    Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.
    Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
    Show that the distribution is approximately normal.

In point 3, focus on the difference between the distribution of a large collection of random exponentials and the distribution of a large collection of averages of 40 exponentials.

As a motivating example, compare the distribution of 1000 random uniforms

and the distribution of 1000 averages of 40 random uniforms

This distribution looks far more Gaussian than the original uniform distribution!

This exercise is asking you to use your knowledge of the theory given in class to relate the two distributions.

Sample Project Report Structure

Of course, there are multiple ways one could structure a report to address the requirements above. However, the more clearly you pose and answer each question, the easier it will be for reviewers to clearly identify and evaluate your work.

A sample set of headings that could be used to guide the creation of your report might be:

    Title (give an appropriate title) and Author Name
    Overview: In a few (2-3) sentences explain what is going to be reported on.
    Simulations: Include English explanations of the simulations you ran, with the accompanying R code. Your explanations should make clear what the R code accomplishes.
    Sample Mean versus Theoretical Mean: Include figures with titles. In the figures, highlight the means you are comparing. Include text that explains the figures and what is shown on them, and provides appropriate numbers.
    Sample Variance versus Theoretical Variance: Include figures (output from R) with titles. Highlight the variances you are comparing. Include text that explains your understanding of the differences of the variances.
    Distribution: Via figures and text, explain how one can tell the distribution is approximately normal.

Part 2: Basic Inferential Data Analysis Instructions

Now in the second portion of the project, we're going to analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.

    Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses
    Provide a basic summary of the data.
    Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. (Only use the techniques from class, even if there's other approaches worth considering)
    State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions.

  theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face="bold"))


# check after this
#Now we will compare tooth growth by supplement using a t-test.

# run t-test
t.test(len~supp,data=ToothGrowth)
#The p-value of this test was 0.06.
Since the p-value is greater than 0.05 and the confidence interval of the test contains zero we can say that supplement types seems to have no impact on Tooth growth based on this test.

Now we’ll compare tooth growth by dose, looking at the different pairs of dose values


# run t-test using dose amounts 0.5 and 1.0
ToothGrowth_sub <- subset(ToothGrowth, ToothGrowth$dose %in% c(1.0,0.5))
t.test(len~dose,data=ToothGrowth_sub)


# run t-test using dose amounts 0.5 and 2.0
ToothGrowth_sub <- subset(ToothGrowth, ToothGrowth$dose %in% c(0.5,2.0))
t.test(len~dose,data=ToothGrowth_sub)

# run t-test using dose amounts 1.0 and 2.0
ToothGrowth_sub <- subset(ToothGrowth, ToothGrowth$dose %in% c(1.0,2.0))
t.test(len~dose,data=ToothGrowth_sub)


#As can be seen, the p-value of each test was essentially zero and the confidence interval of each test does not cross over zero (0).

Based on this result we can assume that the average tooth length increases with an inceasing dose, and therefore the null hypothesis can be rejected.
Conclusions

Given the following assumptions:

    The sample is representative of the population
    The distribution of the sample means follows the Central Limit Theorem

In reviewing our t-test analysis from above, we can conclude that supplement delivery method has no effect on tooth growth/length, however increased dosages do result in increased tooth length.
